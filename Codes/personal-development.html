                Firstly, the main reason to set a goal is to identify the obstacles to achieve it. In addition,
                Michael was advised by Charlie's in the book to write down his goals. 
                By writing down his goals will suddenly make them real, as opposed to what was in his head. 
                Every day there are many opportunities, but there is only one best opportunity. Therefore, choose the most suitable.  
                Being apart of the crowd will cloud an individuals judgment and hamper his professional growth. Hence, placing oneself where expectations are high will increase their professional demand.
                Concurrently, formal education will help persons make a living. Finally, self-study will help individuals become rich.
